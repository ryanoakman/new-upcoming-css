          <h2>Dynamic Viewport Units</h2>
          <h3 class="">About</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional viewport units like VH and VW are great for positioning
            items relative to viewport (what shows on the entire screen). Think:
            fullscreen video hero.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, these units don't take into account mobile UI elements like
            url and navigation bars. When these bars are active, they shift the
            VH element.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <h3 class="">What it does</h3>
          <p>
            Dynamic viewport units recognize two states of the mobile screen:
            when the UI bars are active, and when they're not. These are defined
            as the SVH and the LVH, respectively.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Small viewport (svh): The size of the viewport when the UI bars
              are present on the screen
            </li>
            <li>
              Large viewport (lvh): The size of the viewport when the UI bars
              are not present (like when scrolling)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/small-and-large-vh.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption></figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            These are then recognized and used as guides for the Dynamic
            viewport (DVH) which will automatically adjust itself to be 100% of
            the viewport whether the UI bars are present or not.
          </p>

          <h3 class="">How to use it</h3>

          <h3 class="">Why use it</h3>
          <p>
            In my research, I came across a story of an estimated $8 million
            dollar vh mistake by the
            <a
              href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/a-bashful-button-worth-8-million/"
              >Olive Garden</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            TL;DR: 100vh was not truly 100% of the viewport height, and the
            checkout button was off the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            On desktop browsers, the elements are static. This isn't the case on
            mobile devices. UI elements move as the user scrolls, or interacts.
            With Safari iOS, the url bar shrinks into itself as you scroll down
            the page. At any point, you can stop and click the bar to have it
            expand.
          </p>
          <p>DVH accounts for this, and responds appropriately.</p>
          <h3 class="">Limitations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>93.2% global adoption.</li>
            <li>
              Does not recognize the scrollbar (impacts 100% dynamic viewport
              width)
            </li>
            <li>Does not recognize the keyboard as a UI element.</li>
            <li>
              Dynamic may not be truly dynamic, as browsers can decide whether
              to update the value immediately, or after the interface has
              changed.

        <h2>Text-Wrap: Balance</h2>
        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>
          The text-wrap: balance property in CSS is a feature that helps improve
          the visual appearance of multi-line text, particularly in headings or
          other short text blocks.
        </p>
        <h3>What it does:</h3>
        <p>
          This property attempts to balance the text by distributing the words
          more evenly across the lines. This can result in a more aesthetically
          pleasing and readable text layout. text-wrap: balance will try to
          ensure that both lines have a similar length and appearance rather
          than having one very short line and one very long line.
        </p>
        <h3>Why use it:</h3>
        <p>
          This property can be particularly useful for headlines, banners, and
          other text elements where line breaks can significantly impact
          readability and design.
        </p>
        <h3>Limitations:</h3>
        <p>
          74.55% total support
          <a href="caniuse.com/css-text-wrap-balance">(source)</a>. As of now,
          text-wrap: balance is an experimental feature and may not be fully
          supported in all browsers.
        </p>
        <h3>How to use it:</h3>
        <p>
          Simply include “text-wrap: balance” on the appropriate text property
          within the CSS.

          <h2>Initial Letter</h2>
          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            The initial-letter property in CSS is a feature that allows you to
            style the first letter of a block of text. This can be used to
            create decorative or ornamental effects, or to draw attention to the
            beginning of a paragraph or section.
          </p>
          <h3>What it does</h3>
          <p>
            The initial-letter property allows you to specify the size, style,
            and position of the first letter in a block of text. You can control
            the size of the initial letter, the font style, and the position of
            the letter relative to the surrounding text.
          </p>
          <video controls src="/images/balance-sample.mp4">
            your browser does not support the video tag
          </video>
          <h3>Why use it</h3>
          <p>
            The initial-letter property can be used to create visually
            interesting and engaging text layouts. By styling the first letter
            of a paragraph or section, you can draw attention to the beginning
            of the text and create a more dynamic and visually appealing design.
          </p>
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p>
            The initial-letter property is not supported in all browsers. As of
            now, it is an experimental feature and may not be fully supported in
            all browsers. You may need to use vendor prefixes or fallback
            techniques to ensure that your initial-letter styles are displayed
            correctly in all browsers.
          </p>
          <h3>How to use it</h3>
          <p>
            To use the initial-letter property, simply include it in your CSS
            and specify the desired styles for the first letter of the text. You
            can control the size, style, and position of the initial letter to
            create the desired effect.
